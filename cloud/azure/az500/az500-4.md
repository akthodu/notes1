# Azure SQL Database

`Transparent data encryption` is about the encryption of the data at rest.

`Always Enrypted Feature` You can encrypt the data in transit.

-  Multiple columns in same table or differnt table
- Encrypt single column in a table.

Two types of encryption.

- Deterministic Encryption - Here same encrypted value is generated for any given plain text value. Allows grouping and indexing of encrypted columns,
-  Random Enryption - Most secure. But you cannot group and index the encrypt columns.



There are 2 keys that gets created when alwaysencrypted feaure is enabled in database.

1. Column Master Key: There is encryption key that needs to be stored in an external data store.  here you can store the key in a windows certificate store or in azure key vault service.

2. Column encryption key : This is generated from the column master key and is used to encrypt the actual column.

User implementing the encryption feature needs to have the following permissions for keys - create, get list, sign, verify, wrap key and unwrap key.
